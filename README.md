## 🏛 Database Architecture

The system is optimized for relational integrity and storage efficiency. Below is an example of the structured data model used for treatment records:

```json
{
  "idx": 0,
  "id": "15c5057a-a004-4460-9541-77756f5a7add",
  "patient_id": "a1be5090-7af8-4ded-9204-17d5454d12a3",
  "teeth": ["18", "17"],
  "description": "Root Canal Therapy",
  "cost": "850",
  "date": "2026-01-19",
  "created_at": "2026-01-19T14:58:40Z"
}
